# Summmary

 Hadoken is Minimalist, Simple, Stupid, C++ Utility Library. Hadoken is designed to complement and enhanced missing feature inside the STL and Boost.

- Hadoken does not have any other mandatory dependency than STL and Boost 
- Hadoken is header-only and designed to be embedded
- Hadoken follows STL/Boost code conventions
- Hadoken is under Boost License

# Features

## Random

 - [Random123](https://www.deshawresearch.com/resources_random123.html) implementation of counter based random generator, high quality, crush resistant and faster than mersenne twister
 - Abstract interface to allow runtime random generator selection, fully compatible with C++11 and Boost random distribution

## Format
 - Variadic template one-line string concatenator

## Strings / Format
 - Utility function for one line string concatenation
 - Utility function for wildcard matching
 - Utility function for template substitution ( mustache style, minimalist ) 

## Network
 - Uri library

## Numeric
 - Float equality / close to functions
 - string to integral / float converters 

## Containers
 - small_vector: Vector with small size optimization. In the spirit of [LLVM small vector](http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1SmallVector.html)

## Parallel
 - Partial C++17 Parallel STL implementation compatible with C++11

## Thread
 - spinlock: simple implementation
 - latch: barrier with counter implementation

## Executors
 - C++ 20 Executors implementations
 - Thread pool executor
 - Single thread executor
 
## State Machine
 - Simple, type-safe, callback based Finite State Machine (FSM) implementation

## Parse opts / getopts
 - Command line option parser
 - Support sub-commands
 - Support auto-help generation
 - Sax style parsing
